# 🏎️ Caparica Grand Prix

A procedural console-based racing game developed in Java.

## 🏆 Achievement
**Ranked 1st in Course:** This project received the **highest grade (18.7/20)** in the *Introdução à Programação* course at NOVA School of Science and Technology (FCT NOVA) in 2025.

## 📝 Project Overview
This project was designed under strict academic constraints to master procedural programming logic before moving to Object-Oriented Programming.

* **Constraint:** The entire game logic had to be implemented in a **single file** (`Main.java`) without using custom Classes or Objects.
* **Core Concepts:** Arrays, loops, static methods, state management, and algorithmic logic.

## 🎮 Features
* **Procedural Track Generation:** The track is built dynamically based on input configurations.
* **AI Opponents:** Features multiple AI drivers with collision avoidance and speed management logic.
* **Collision System:** Handles "yellow flag" situations where cars must find empty slots or slow down.
* **Dynamic Hazards:** Track elements like `BOOST (+)`, `DRAG (-)`, and `OIL (!)` affect car physics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java (Procedural)
* **Tools:** IntelliJ

## 👥 Credits
* **Author:** Rodrigo Afonso Cardoso
* **Debugging Assistance:** Google Gemini (Used for debugging collision logic in `checkPosStatus` and `findEmptySlot`).
